![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png)

### Overview

An app for authenticated users to post on a job board where they are able to display their individual talents to the clients and get hired.


### Project Brief

You must:
- Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end.
- Use an Express API to serve your data from a Mongo database.
- Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React.
- Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models.
- Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut.
- Have a visually impressive design to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. Allow time for this.
- Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible.
- Have automated tests for at least one RESTful resource on the back-end, and at least one classical and one functional component on the front-end. Improve your employability by demonstrating a good understanding of testing principals.
